# Plotting-in-Python-with-Matplotlib

## Pre-Course Instructions

### Webinar Instructions

To complete this course, you will need to run Jupyter Notebook files on your computer. You can run the files in a Codespace (see the instructions [below](#opening-a-codespace)) or locally on your own computer (see the instructions [below](#running-the-course-locally)). If you intend to run it locally, you should make sure you have installed the appropriate packages outline in the [Packages](#packages) section below before the course.

### Face to Face Course Instructions

This course will take place in a college computer room. To complete this course, you will need to run Jupyter Notebook files on your computer. You can do this either on a College computer or on your own laptop. You can run the files in a Codespace (see the instructions [below](#opening-a-codespace)) or locally (see the instructions [below](#running-the-course-locally)). If you intend to run it locally, you should make sure you have installed the appropriate packages outline in the [Packages](#packages) section below before the course.

### Self-Study Instructions

This course can also be completed through self-study from this repository. To do this, you will need to run the Jupyter Notebooks on your computer. These should be studied in numerical order. You should read the descriptions, examine the examples, and complete the exercises.

## Opening a Codespace

A [Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) is a development environment hosted by GitHub directly from a repository. To use this, you will need to be signed into a GitHub account. To open the Codespace, click the green ```Code``` button at the top right of the repository. Make sure you're in the ```Codespaces``` tab and click the ```Create New Codespace on Master``` button. This will create a Codespace of your own. This will take a minute or so to initialise. You may be asked to reload the page. If so, do reload the page.

Once your Codespace has initialised, it will remain associated with your GitHub account for around a month, when it will expire. Your Codespace will be given a name like "fuzzy-barnacle" so you can identify it. To reopen it on a future occasion, click the ```Code``` button again, then select the Codespace, click ```Open```, then ```Open in Browser```.

To download the content of the files within the Codespace, open the Files tab on the left, select the files, right click and click ```Download``` button. Alternatively, if you're familiar with GitHub, you can open the source control tab on the left, you can commit and push changes. This will fork the repository with your changes. Either of these options will allow you to keep a copy of the course notes with your solutions to the exercises, etc.

## Running the Course Locally

If you want to run the course notes locally, you can download them by clicking [here](https://github.com/coolernato/Plotting-in-Python-with-Matplotlib/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Extract the files to a location of your choice on your computer. You can open the notebooks from here using Jupyter in Anaconda, inside VS Code, or wherever else you like to run JupyterNotebooks.

## Packages

Whether you attend a face-to-face or webinar version of this course or if you intend to self-study, if you intend to run the code in Anaconda, install the following packages in your Python environment before you attend to avoid having to do so during the course:

* matplotlib
* numpy
* ipykernel

These packages are also specified in the ```requirements.txt``` file, which you can use to install the appropriate files if you're familiar with requirements files.
